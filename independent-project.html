      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <div class="orl">
        <ol>
          <li>The boring lecture project displayed my uses of HTML and CSS and using the class command. The page is about a lecture that is so boring that even the professor falls asleep.</li>
          <li>The Animal shelter is an example of some HTML and CSS while using dif tags and cascading. This page is aboutan exotic animal shelter who adopts out crazy animals.</li>
          <li>Resort project is the begging stages of the intro course when we learned git, HTML and CSS. The Resort Project was my partner making a site for a nice fake resort in Mexico</li>
          <li>The vacation site was made using CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. This site is about a vacation and resort that my partner and I would have liked to stay at.</li>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <div class="par"
        <p>I am a guy with many interests and my latest has become coding! I enjoy the constant challenge and always feeling like I may need to spend a little more time on something to fully grasp it, that makes me want to spend my spare time trying new things. I also love being outside and everything that comes along with it. I am a very social person that thrives in environments where I am able to interact and meet new people. A few of my favorite things are backpacking, riding bikes, fishing, camping, hunting, swimming and spending time with friends.</p>
