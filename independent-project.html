      <h2>Project Details</h2>

      <ol>

      <div class="par"
        <p>I am a guy with many interests and my latest has become coding! I enjoy the constant challenge and always feeling like I may need to spend a little more time on something to fully grasp it, that makes me want to spend my spare time trying new things. I also love being outside and everything that comes along with it. I am a very social person that thrives in environments where I am able to interact and meet new people. A few of my favorite things are backpacking, riding bikes, fishing, camping, hunting, swimming and spending time with friends.</p>
